# PySpark Project: Learning PySpark with Practical Applications

This repository documents my journey learning PySpark, covering various data science and machine learning techniques using Apache Spark. Each module focuses on a specific topic and includes a dataset for hands-on practice.

## Modules

1. **00_Spark_Data_Frames**: Introduction to Spark DataFrames, data manipulation, and essential transformations.
2. **01_Regression_Analysis**: Implementation of regression models, including linear regression using Spark MLlib.
3. **02_Tree_Methods**: Exploration of decision trees and random forests for classification and regression tasks.
4. **03_K_Means_Clustering**: Application of K-Means clustering for unsupervised learning on large datasets.
5. **04_Recommender_System**: Building collaborative filtering recommendation systems with Spark's ALS algorithm.
6. **05_Natural_Language_Processing**: Basics of NLP using Spark, including tokenization, stopword removal, and text vectorization.
7. **06_Spark_Streaming**: Real-time data processing using Spark Streaming.

Each module contains a `datasets` folder with the necessary data files.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Spark DataFrames**: For efficient data processing.
- **MLlib**: Used for implementing machine learning models.
- **SparkSession**: Entry point for running Spark applications.
- **VectorAssembler**: For feature vector creation from raw data.

## Learning Outcomes

This project allowed me to gain practical experience with PySpark's core functionalities and MLlib, enhancing my understanding of large-scale data processing, machine learning model implementation, and the use of Spark for big data analytics.

## Acknowledgments

This repository was built as part of my PySpark learning journey, with a focus on practical exercises and mock consulting projects.
